## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Cleared

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation
**Challenge**: Restricting access to sensitive areas (like User Management) based on user roles (Admin, Manager, Cashier) caused backend crashes due to circular imports or missing dependencies.
**Resolution**: 
- Fixed the `NameError` in `users.py` by correctly importing `require_manager_or_above`.
- Implemented frontend redirects in `users.tsx` for unauthorized users.
- Verified with comprehensive test scripts.

### 2. Inventory Categories Fix
**Challenge**: The "Manage Categories" feature was non-functional; adding new categories failed silently.
**Resolution**:
- Diagnosed as a side-effect of the RBAC import error crashing the server.
- Fixed the import, restarted the server, and verified with `quick_test_categories.py`.

### 3. PDF Receipt Generation
**Challenge**: Generating PDF receipts failed due to key mismatches (`product_id` vs `item_id`) in the API payload.
**Resolution**:
- Updated `sales_service.py` and test scripts to use consistent keys.
- Successfully generated and saved PDF receipts locally.

- **Goal**: Provide a dedicated page for users to view and manage notifications.

### Comprehensive System Re-Test
- **Goal**: Verify all features (Auth, Inventory, Sales, PDF, RBAC) work together.
- **Result**: 
    - ✅ Login successful for all roles.
    - ✅ Inventory creation works.
    - ✅ Sales & PDF generation works.
